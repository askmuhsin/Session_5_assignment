# Target:
* Increase LR to 0.2
-- Background
* Last model was trained on dataset with more augmentation, and therefore was taking more epochs to converge.
* Now Trying with a higher learning rate, inorder to get desired accuracy within 15 epochs.

# Results:
* Parameters: 9,958
* Best Training Accuracy: 97.88% (EPOCH 14)
* Best Test Accuracy: 99.25% (EPOCH 14)

# Analysis:
* LR has not helped to increase the acc within 15 epochs.
